## 📌 About This Repository

Welcome to **My Java Learning** repository! This is a curated space where I document and practice what I've learned while studying Java. Whether you're a beginner looking for examples or someone revisiting Java concepts, you might find something useful here.


The content ranges from:
- ✅ Basic syntax and Java fundamentals
- 🔁 Control structures and loops
- 🧰 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- 💾 File I/O and exception handling
- 🌐 Mini-projects and practice exercises


## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to clone and explore the repository on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eltaf-azizi/My-java-learning.git
```


### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
Copy
Edit
cd My-java-learning
```
### 3. Open in your preferred IDE or code editor
Recommended: IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code

## 🛠️ How to Run Java Code
Each .java file typically contains a main method. To compile and run:

```bash
Copy
Edit
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```
Or use the Run button in your IDE if available.

## 📖 Topics I'm Exploring
 - Java basics and data types

 - Loops and conditional statements

 - Arrays and collections (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)

 - OOP principles (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)

 - Exception handling

 - File input/output

 - Java 8+ features (Streams, Lambda expressions)

 - Simple CLI-based Java projects

## 🧠 Stay Tuned
I will continue updating this repository as I cover more Java topics and build new mini-projects. Future plans include:

 - JavaFX GUI applications

 - Unit testing with JUnit

 - Multithreading and concurrency

 - Networking and sockets

 - Connecting Java with databases (JDBC, SQLite, etc.)
